# CUDA-GMM

###Introduction
Gaussian Mixture Model accelerated by CUDA

This is a simple example on how to use cuda to accelerate the GMM. You can use this program to extract the moving objects from webcam. I only use opencv3.0 for reading frames from camera and showing the image filtered by my GMM. That's all i use the extra library. It's easy to understand the algorithm in this example. 

這是一個狠簡單的例子，CUDA加速高斯混合模型可以濾出攝影機中會移動的物件，我只使用opencv3.0讀攝影機及顯示照片的結果，可以從這個例子清楚了解演算法的實作。
